The World Travel and Tourism Council reported that India\\'s travel and tourism sector contributed nearly Rs 21 trillion to the economy in 2024, supporting approximately 46.5 million jobs (9.1% of total employment).\\n\\nStates and Union territories of India with their names.\\n\\n\\n== Andaman and Nicobar Islands ==\\n\\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands, first settled around 26,000 years ago, form an archipelago of 572 tropical islands, of which only 37 are inhabited. Tourism plays a major economic role in the islands. According to official estimates, tourist arrivals tripled from 130,000 in 2016 to 430,000 in 2017.\\nThe islands straddle the fault line between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Sunda Plate, and their topography reflects millions of years of volcanism and tectonics. Barren Island hosts South Asia’s only active volcano, which typically erupts every one to two years; its most recent eruption occurred in 2024.\\nThe most notable historical site is the Cellular Jail in Port Blair. Built in 1906 during the British Raj, it became notorious for its harsh conditions and use as a political prison for members of India’s independence movement.
