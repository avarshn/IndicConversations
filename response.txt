 I am a large language model (LLM) created by Sarvam AI, an Indian startup focused on building generative AI applications tailored for Indian users. While I don't have a specific "trainer" in the traditional sense, my training involved learning from a vast dataset of text and code to generate responses. Let me know if you'd like more details about how LLMs function!
